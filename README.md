# Playmaker-Invaders

--------------
What is this?

For a long time I've wanted to do a collaborative project with more members of the Playmaker community.
I finally decided, starting a project, putting it on Github, and letting ANYONE contribute, could be a pretty fun experiment.

I tried thinking of the most simple game idea, that would be easy for others to understand and build upon.
The game that came to mind was "Space Invaders".
